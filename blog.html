        Welcome To My Blog!
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is where I'll be sharing my love for music, specifically
        instrumental music! A little disclaimer, I don't <br />know much about
        music, I just really like listening to it and formulating my opinions on
        it, even though I lack a<br />
        lot of knowledge in the music genre. In this first section, you can see
        some of my most favorite performances ever, <br />musicians I find
        inspirational, and just see me completely nerd out about music for a
        little. In the next section, you'll <br />see a couple of videos from my
        favorite high school performances that I had either performed in or just
        really enjoyed during <br />my high school career. Hopefully, watching
        some of these videos will help you gain a new sense of love for music
        <br />or help you be inspired by the sheer amount of skill, hard work,
        and dedication radiating in these musician's performances.<br />
        Even if you're not a huge music nerd (specifically classical music), I'm
        sure you'll find at least one performance you like. <br />Stay awesome
        and keep practicing ♫♪♬♫♩

          Tchaikovsky Serenade, m. I - Pezzo in forma di Sonatina
        </h3>
        <h4 class="date">Memory by A Far Cry</h4>
        <p class="blog-content">
          I really like this performance for many reasons: first, I really love
          how beautiful and vibrant each note is. Next, the <br />acoustics are
          amazing and I love how everyone is standing up (besides the celli of
          course) as opposed to the traditional <br />orchestra. Since everyone
          is standing up, there's so much movement and energy in the
          performance. Lastly, since no one is <br />reading sheet music,
          they're all able to look at each other and connect, making the
          peformance feel more interconnected. <br />Everything about this
          performance is phenomenal and I love it so much!

        <p class="blog-content">
          I really like Brooklyn Duo's performances and arrangements, however, I
          must say, this is one of my absolutely favorite <br />performances
          they have. There's so much energy in the music and everyone connects
          so well! Everything feels balances and no<br />
          one overpowers each other. I really like the video movement because
          the camera isn't static so the video feels energenic. One thing
          <br />that does bum me out whenever I watch this video is that the
          performance was filmed at Carnegie Hall and my orchestra was
          supposed<br />
          to go to Carnegie Hall this year to perform but then Corona happened.

          My favorite duet pieces of all time, and my favorite performance of
          that piece of all time! Their phrasing is exceptional and <br />their
          connection with each other is amazing! It's so much more amazing when
          you know that both performers were 15 at the time <br />of this
          performance! It's so amazing seeing how much skill they have at such a
          young age! This piece is nicknamed the "Impossible Duet"<br />because
          of how difficult it is to learn and perform this piece so it's awesome
          seeing two prodigies perform this. Totally doesn't destroy<br />
          my self-esteem.

          Lang Lang's performances are always so exceptional and this

          technique<br />
          used in his pieces, especially in this piece. The amount of hours it
          must've taken to be this graceful at such a technical piece is
          <br />just amazing.

          because of how breathless her technique <br />is. That 4th finger

          One thing I like to look at when Ray Chen is performing is always his
          eyebrows (besides his immaculate vibrato) lol! His <br />face is so
          full of emotions and it's so beautiful how it's translated into his
          performance! One thing I definitely love about Ray Chen <br />is his
          connection and involvement with his community. He's been doing a lot
          of streams lately where he gives insight on what <br />it takes to be
          a world class violinist (my favorite stream is the one where
          <a href="https://youtu.be/N8cYpZ6AQf4">
            he reviewed his own playing </a
          >), answers questions, and even <br />reviews his fan's playing! The
          fact that he's a world class violinist who is pretty close with his
          community and fan base is so crazy to me. <br />I love that he makes
          time for his fans and stuff.

          This performance is well done! From the amazing bow usage to the

          Roman Kim's technique is so amazing and I love his interpretations.
          However, I always get confused around 3:21 because <br />I'm not even

          Another violin piece that's regarded as one of the hardest pieces to

          is incredible. I would talk about what's so amazing about his
          performance but I feel like I'm just repeating myself over and over
          again.<br />
          Regardless, it's awesome that he has such awesome phrasing and amazing
          technique at just 16 years old, I'm totally not jealous!

          This was one of the first pieces I played at Stilwell. It was probably
          a couple of days into my freshmen year and my orchestra teacher
          gave<br />
          everyone 3 pieces (I don't remember the order specifically). It was

            Perseus - Soon Hee Newbold
          </a>
          <br />and this piece, and he basically made us all sight-read us to
          see what level we were all on collectively. I remember feeling
          horrible because <br />I could barely read the sheet music, count, and
          play, and I remember feeling even worse when we had a rehearsal and
          the <br />seniors next to me sounded awesome compared to me. It's
          crazy comparing my skill set from freshman year to now.

          Otherwise, have fun listening/watching this performance. <br />This
          was a rehearsal my orchestra did my school's gym (my school doesn't
          have sports so our gym is tinier than the average gym) <br />so
          there's a couple mistakes here and there but the acoustics is
          definitely nice! It brings me so much nostalgia watching this video
          <br />because I remember how much work I had to pour in to perform
          these pieces. It's nice listening back to old videos because <br />it
          makes me think of a time where I dedicated A LOT of my time into
          orchestra and makes me remember how I used to spend <br />a lot of
          time staying after school to rehearse with my orchestra.

          This piece was always super fun to play but it did get boring very

          and the whole orchestra laughed. That is one of my favorite
          <br />memories of orchestra during my freshmen year :)

          This was always a fun piece to perform because of the energy everyone
          emitted whenever we performed this. One thing I'll <br />always
          remember from this piece was that I always associated the beginning to
          the Wii theme song, so the first few rehearsals practicing <br />this
          piece was so hilarious to me. I remember singing along with friends to
          this piece and being extra dramatic and obnoxious whenever<br />
          there was a pizz.

          I didn't perform in this group, but dang, you gotta admit, everyone in
          this group sounds so exceptional! Again for a <br />professional

          I remember being so proud of everyone in <br />this group. They all
          sound so amazing. One thing I definitely remember about the next day
          (we had a performance) was my dinner. So, <br />basically, my
          orchestra left school early to get to the performance area and I
          didn't have money to pay for dinner, and we were going to stay
          <br />there for a couple of more hours so I basically had to make do.
          I remember that morning, I went to the cafeteria and grabbed a bowl of
          <br />chocolate cereal, which I later placed into my backpack (I
          collect cereal from the cafeteria to snack on during school,
          specifically during <br />rehearsals) so I grabbed that out my
          backpack for dinner. Unfortuntely, I wanted to eat it with milk but
          I'm not a psychopath who carries milk<br />
          in their bookbag, so what I did was grab my water I always carry on me
          and make do. I kid you not, the second I pour it into my cereal,
          <br />I look up to see a line of my classmates who're waiting in line
          for their Chik-Fil-A food just start laughing like crazy and staring
          at me. <br />It was definitely a fond memory I have of my friends and
          that performance.

          I'm not performing in this video. This was the senior's last
          performance together. When the performance ended, I cried a
          <br />little because I had to say goodbye to so many amazing, talented
          seniors. It definitely makes me excited for my eventual <br />senior

          At my school, we have an annual tradition with the seniors called
          "Senior Showcase." Basically, the seniors in each <br />department
          will create their own program where every senior has a chance to
          showcase their skills and what they learned <br />throughout their
          high school career (Each department has their own program - There's no
          joint program with all the seniors from <br />each department). That
          year, one of the seniors wanted to showcase their conducting skills
          and selected a small group of musicians to<br />
          perform while he conducts and yay, he picked me! This is the only
          video on this blog where you can actually see me lol. Anyways, <br />I
          was honored and performed and it was really fun. I was moving with the
          music and it was nice performing with my peers in <br />a smaller
          group. Because of Covid-19, there was unfortunately no senior showcase
          this school year :( However, I'm super excited to<br />
          perform and help create the senior showcase program next year
          alongside my fellow c/o 2021 orchestra classmates :D

          I'm not performing but I thought I should put this because even though
          I don't know a majority of the people in that group and <br />a
          majority of them don't know me, I'm immensely proud of each and every
          one of them! It's amazing listening to their first <br />performance
          to what they sound like now, and that definitely doesn't come from
          nowhere - it comes from hours of hard work, dedication, <br />and
          mindful practice. I remember when I saw this performance, I teared up
          because they sound incredible compared to what they sounded <br />like
          in the beginning of the year. Fun fact: this was the last day in
          school before we eventually left because of Covid-19.<br />
          We left on a "good note" ;)
