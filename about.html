        <p class="me">
          I was born and rasied in Georgia. A majority of my life revolves
          around the arts. <br />From a young age, I picked up piano while
          drawing dogs, cats, and starfishes <br />on the side. Eventually, in
          middle school, I started taking art seriously. This was <br />also
          around the period where I started learning the violin as well! Only
          having less <br />than a year of experience in the violin, I decided
          to audition for art and orchestra at a <br />performing arts school
          near me. Fortunetly, I was accepted into both programs!
          <br />Currently, I attend that performing arts high school where I
          major in playing the violin <br />and minor in art. In my free time, I
          really enjoy piano, playing ukulele, animating, <br />composing music,
          listening to music, cooking, reading, and journaling/scrapbooking!
